a commandline interface to github issues and pull requests
---

This is a personal project to learn a handful of technologies I've never
developed myself.
 - `ncurses` UI development
 - `oauth` authentication
 - the GitHub API

Long-term, I hope to use this to manage issues and PRs of my own GitHub
repositories.
